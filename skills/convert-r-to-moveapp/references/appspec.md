## appspec.json:

The appspec.json file is used to define the specifications of an App within MoveApps.
- Read and follow the official [App Specification](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec?id=appspecjson)
- Fetch the current [Template_R_Function_App/appspec.json](https://github.com/movestore/Template_R_Function_App/blob/master/appspec.json) as the structural template.
- For `version`, use the value or format required by the current live in [Template_R_Function_App/appspec.json](https://github.com/movestore/Template_R_Function_App/blob/master/appspec.json). Do not invent it.
  
Currently, the following specifications can/need to be added:

1- Settings:
- Read and follow the official MoveApps specification for [Settings](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/README).
- Follow the official [example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/README?id=example).
- Every setting needs `id` (matches the R argument name), `name` (short label), `description` (plain language), and `defaultValue`. Choose
`type` based on what the argument represents
- For each setting type, consult the corresponding current documentation:
  - [Text](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/string) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/string?id=example).
  - [Integer numbers](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/integer) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/integer?id=example).
  - [Real numbers](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/double) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/double?id=example).
  - [Date selection](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/timestamp) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/timestamp?id=example).
  - [Radiobuttons](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/radiobuttons) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/radiobuttons?id=example).
  - [Checkboxes](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/checkbox) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/checkbox?id=example).
  - [Dropdown](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/dropdown) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/dropdown?id=example).
  - [Passwords](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/secret) and [Example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/secret?id=example).
  - [Auxiliary/user files](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/settings/user_file).
    
- Determine the appropriate setting type from the App's R function arguments and behavior. Follow the current documentation rather than hard-coded rules in this file.

2- Dependencies:
  - Read and follow the official MoveApps specification for [Dependencies](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/dependencies_appspec) 
  - All libraries on which the App needs for its construction and/or runtime.
  - Do not include any base library in the appspecs.json file.
  - For a CRAN package, just use `{"name": "pkgname"}`, if required the version can also be specified in the argument "version". For a package that comes from somewhere else (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), use the functions provided by the library  [`"remotes"`](https://remotes.r-lib.org/reference/index.html).
  - Follow the official [Examples](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/dependencies_appspec?id=example).

3-Provided App Files:

If the App developer can/wants to provide either fixed or fallback auxiliary files, these files must be defined as providedAppFiles. This category of the appspec.json defines the ID by which the auxiliary file can be addressed and its location in the App file bundle.
  - Read and follow the official MoveApps specification for ["providedAppFiles"](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/providedAppFiles_appspec).
  - For more detailed check [Auxiliary Files](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/auxiliary) section.

  -  Follow the official [example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/license_appspec?id=example).
  - Check the license options from which the license key has to be entered: [List of license keys](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/license_appspec?id=list-of-license-keys) and then check the links of those 4 options:

- Ask the user for information for the people part: "firstName", "middleInitials", "lastName", "email", "roles",  "orcid", "affiliation", "affiliationRor".
- list the people like the [example](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/appspec/current/people_appspec?id=example).

## Validation
- After generating appspec.json, verify that it follows the current official MoveApps specification and template.
- The user can additionally validate the result with the MoveApps [Settings Editor ](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/settingseditor).
