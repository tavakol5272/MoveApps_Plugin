## App Documentation

- Create the `README.md` based on the official MoveApps [Template](https://github.com/movestore/Template_R_Function_App/blob/master/README.md).
- Follow the template strictly. Read and use the instructional text under each section as guidance for what content to provide, but do not copy the template's instructional text or example text into the final README.
- **Name of App:** Use the App name chosen in the workflow step that determines the App's display name. Use the same display title in the README and preserve the required **Title Case without hyphens** convention.
- **Github repository:**
  1. If the user has provided the repository URL in the conversation or workflow context, include it.
  2. If no repository URL has been provided, remove the template placeholder and leave nothing after `Github repository:`.
  3. Do not invent or guess a repository URL.
  4. After generating the README, inform the user that the repository URL still needs to be added if it was unavailable.
- Complete the README using verifiable information from the actual App files, especially `appspec.json`, the R source code, tests, and other generated App files where relevant.
- Ensure that the documented application scope, required data properties, input/output types, artefacts, settings, changes in output data, error/null handling, and technical details accurately reflect the implementation.
- Do not invent functionality, settings, data requirements, output fields, artefacts, repository information, or runtime behaviour.
- If information required by the template cannot be verified from the project files or workflow context, mark it as `TODO: verify`.
- Omit the optional screenshot block unless the user provides a suitable screenshot.
- Include the optional **Technical details** section when sufficient implementation information is available.
- The final output must be a clean, App-specific, publication-ready `README.md` that follows the current MoveApps README template.
- Before finalizing, verify that:
  - the App title is present and follows the **Title Case without hyphens** convention;
  - the `Github repository:` line is present and is either filled with the user-provided repository URL or correctly left blank, with no template placeholder remaining;
  - all required template sections are present:
    - Description
    - Documentation
    - Application scope
      - Generality of App usability
      - Required data properties
    - Input type
    - Output type
    - Artefacts
    - Settings
    - Changes in output data
    - Errors and null handling
  - the optional **Technical details** section is included when sufficient implementation information is available.
